## Shake Mouse To Locate (Windows)

Shake or circle the mouse quickly and a big mouse
will show for a short while. This will help you find
back the mouse cursor.

Forked by Nicolas de Jong (nicolas@rutilo.nl)
Original by Spinal Cord (http://spinalcode.co.uk/)

Altered because the original showed the big mouse
too often. Now it shows only after moving the mouse
pointer left and right quickly a few times.

Also added flags for autostart, enabled, ctrl and sensitivity.

Name and tooltip were chosen to coincide with the Mac feature this is similar to.

#### Note

This application is created using [AutoIt](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/).
Its scripts are sometimes flagged as being a virus. While it is quite possible to write
viruses with AutoIt, this application is certainly not. If you feel more confident
compiling the source code that you checked for naughty bits, install AutoIt, load the
ShakeMouseToLocate.au3 in the AutoIt SciTE-Lite editor and select Tools, Build. That
will generate the exe as well.
